# The goal here is mainly to confirm that Pandana compiles in Windows; we're not
# running any of the CI tests

# Cython and NumPy need to be present before building Pandana. Some other
# runtime requirements aren't installing well with Pip in win-py27, so I'm just
# including them in the Conda environment: Scikit-learn, Pandana, Matplotlib.
